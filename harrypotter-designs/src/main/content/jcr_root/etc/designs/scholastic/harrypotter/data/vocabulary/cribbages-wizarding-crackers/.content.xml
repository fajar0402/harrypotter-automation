    definition="Crackers are party favors used in the United Kingdom at Christmastime. Small cardboard tubes are filled with candy and trinkets, then wrapped in brightly colored paper that's twisted at each end. When two people pull on opposite ends of the paper, the tube bursts open with a loud CRACK  and the treats inside fall out."
